- 2024-12-01: re construct the directory structure
- 2024-12-01: After using WindSurf for several days, I've discovered some issues, including:
    1. Each generated program has a different style, requiring many adjustments
    2. When AI tries to fix errors, it may introduce more problems
    3. In the process of fixing errors, original code often gets modified, leading to unexpected consequences
    4. The code is quite redundant, feeling like it just works but isn't particularly well-optimized
- 2024-12-01: I try to maintain a template, I had ask WindSurf to help me, but it was making more problems, so I have to write by myself.
- 2024-12-17: These past few days, I've been stuck on updating JPA's related tables, constantly encountering unique constraint issues that I couldn't resolve. Finally, after sending the entire error message to Windsurf, I was able to find and fix the error. Another observation from these days is that you need to guide Windsurf step by step to complete tasks - if you give it broad topics, the results can be quite unpredictable and varied.
- 2024-12-18: Today I mainly focused on making modifications, including adjusting inappropriate relationships and modifying certain fields. These tasks are very convenient to do with WindSurf, but it requires step-by-step guidance; otherwise, many issues might arise. I wonder if there's a way for AI to remember these prompts for direct use next time, eliminating the need for repetition.
